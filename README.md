Used Car Price Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as age, mileage, brand, engine size, and more. The model is designed to help both sellers and buyers estimate a fair price for a used car, making the buying and selling process more transparent and efficient.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about used cars, including features like the car's brand, year of manufacture, mileage, engine capacity, and more. The target variable is the selling_price, which the model attempts to predict.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
statsmodels
matplotlib (optional, if you plan to visualize the results)

Project Structure
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded using pandas.
Unnecessary columns are dropped, and the data is cleaned by handling missing values and duplicates.
Categorical features are converted into numerical values using replace().
Feature Engineering:

The car brand is extracted from the car name.
Columns like mileage, max_power, and engine are cleaned and converted to numeric values.
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into input features (X) and the target variable (Y).
The data is further split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
Model Training:

A Linear Regression model is used to predict the selling price of the cars.
The model is trained on the training set using model.fit().
Model Evaluation:

The performance of the model is evaluated using the R² score and adjusted R² score.
Prediction:

The model makes predictions on the test set and on new, hypothetical data.

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/used-car-price-prediction.git
cd used-car-price-prediction
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open Employee Attrition Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells to train the model and make predictions.

Results
The model's performance is evaluated using R² and adjusted R² scores. You can further explore model improvements by experimenting with different features or using more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
